<<do this.image('queen')>>
The Good Queen has passed, as all must. The burden to rule falls now to The Na√Øve Heir, and their table of knights.

To You, and your advisors.
<<BR>>
It happened so suddenly. "Cut down in her prime", they'll say, looking back on it.

But that's not what they say today.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('blank')>>
Today, they shout
"The Queen is dead!"

Today, they chant
"Long live The Queen!"
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('sword')>>
No sooner than the news has reached your ears, you are ushered off to private chambers.

An official coronation will be held soon, but the round table does not wait.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('roundTable')>>
You look around the room, and at the five people seated:
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('justiciar')>>
The Noble Justiciar serves as judge, jury, and if needed, executioner.

The Queen rules by divine right, but he speaks for the church.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('veteran')>>
The Seasoned Veteran has fought many battles, and will fight many more.

He is not always victorious, but he has never lost.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('scholar')>>
The Wounded Scholar was The Good Queen's closest advisor.

A lifetime ago he fought on the front lines. He earned his knighthood through less violent means much later.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('cousin')>>
The Distant Cousin was knighted as a show of good faith between far-flung branches of the family.

They recently travelled a long way from The Northern Isles, and are now next in line by royal blood.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('huntress')>>
The Obsessed Huntress and your mother were inseparable as children.

Or so you've heard; you're not sure you've ever seen them together.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('blank')>>
And there is an empty seat at the opposite end of the table.

The Queen's seat.

[[Take your seat]]
[[Remain standing]]

::Take your seat
<<do this.image('roundTable')>>
You walk around the table, passing by The Veteran and The Scholar. The Justiciar rises as you walk, and pulls the chair out for you.

You take The Queen's seat.

[[Continue|this.goto('intro-2')]]

::Remain standing
<<do this.image('roundTable')>>
You ignore the empty chair, and speak to those seated from where you stand.

[[Continue|this.goto('intro-2')]]

::intro-2
How do you address your knights?

[[Courageous]]
[[Collected]]
[[Confident]]

::Courageous
<<do this.image('sword')>>
"My mother's death shall not be in vain."

"We need only work together, and there is nothing we cannot achieve!"
<<BR>>
Your Cousin attempts to start a round of applause, but stops when no one joins in after the first few claps.
[-WINE]

[[Continue|this.goto('intro-3')]]

::Collected
<<do this.image('sword')>>
"This moment was inevitable, but I am saddened at how soon it has come."

"This will be a difficult role to fill, but I feel confident, knowing that I have you all by my side."
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('roundTable')>>
The room stays silent, but when they look to you, it is with a hint of something more in their eyes.
[+WINE]

[[Continue|this.goto('intro-3')]]


::Confident
<<do this.image('sword')>>
"You all used to serve my mother. Now you serve me."

"The Queen is dead. Long live The Queen."
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('roundTable')>>
No one questions your words.
[+SALT]

[[Continue|this.goto('intro-3')]]

::intro-3
<<do this.image('scholar')>>
Eventually, The Scholar speaks up:

"Your Majesty, there is something more we need to share with you."

The Huntress pulls out a map, and places it on the table.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('map')>>
"As you know, this is the known world."

"There have been reports of troubling nature from the distant corners of the world."
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('abstract3')>>
"People - entire settlements - are going supposedly missing."

"It was just one or two at first, at the furthest reaches. But it's happening more often, and closer."
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('scholar')>>
"Something is coming."

"We don't know what it is, or when it will arrive."

"But we have to prepare for the worst."
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('roundTable')>>
The meeting ends on a dour note.

[[Continue|this.goto('week-mid')]]

No one says it aloud, but you are certain that they all feel it the same as you do.

::salt-event-end
<<do this.image('veteran')>>
You decide to tour the barracks and see how The Seasoned Veteran is faring with the troops.
<<BR>>
You hear the telltale sounds of shouts and clanking metal as you approach.
<<BR>>
Something is different, though.

It sounds scattered, disorganized. It is not the lessons and drills you've come to expect.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('battleWon')>>
You arrive just in time to witness the end of a fist-fight.

Men stand around in a circle, cheering as a pair scuffle in the dirt.
<<BR>>
One has clearly secured the advantage, and pummels the other until someone jumps in to pull him off.

You look around for The Veteran in the crowd, but he is nowhere to be seen.

[[Search for him]]
[[Leave them alone]]

::Leave them alone
<<do this.flag('left-veteran', 1)>>
You decide it would be best not to poke the nest of rowdy soldiers.

A few men attempt sloppy salutes as you leave the barracks.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('hall')>>
From outside, you hear cheers start up once again, presumably along with another fight.

[[Continue|this.goto('end-choice')]]


::Search for him
<<do this.image('hall')>>
You head deeper into the barracks, hoping to at least find some explanation as to what is happening.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('veteran')>>
You find him in the sleeping quarters, laughing along with a dozen or so other men.

You can smell the alcohol before you even enter the room.
<<BR>>
"Young miss! Come, join us!"

[[Join them]]
[[Excuse yourself|this.goto('Leave them alone')]]

::Join them
<<do this.image('bandaged')>>
You notice that a number of the faces present are battered and bloodied, but they don't seem to mind.

One of them passes you a jug.
<<BR>>
You take a sip and pass it along.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('veteran')>>
"It's been a long week."
<<BR>>
"But nothing like a good fight to calm your nerves, eh?"

The Veteran slaps his neighbour on the back, who coughs and sputters.
<<BR>>
"I was just telling the lads about the last time The Avaricious Empire invaded our lands."

"What a fight it was!"
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('battle')>>
"It was the dead of winter. The cowards planned to attack at night, but we were ready for them."

"We simply had to wait..."
<<BR>>
He launches into a tale of the old invasion and the ensuing conflicts.

He goes on for hours, revelling in the gory details, cursing betrayals, rising and falling with the tides of war.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('veteran')>>
He pounds his fists with the beats, pantomimes the swings and blows.
<<BR>>
You're unsure how much of it is true, and how much is drunken embellishment, but find yourself getting caught up in the tales nonetheless.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('battleWon')>>
"...and at long last, we were victorious!"

The gathered crowd cheers, and you along with them.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('veteran')>>
You realize with a start how much more crowded it is - more soldiers have filtered in from the fights, and they all laugh and carouse together with The Seasoned Veteran.
<<BR>>
It's quite a merry band he's put together. But more than that, they're ready.

You can see it in their faces, behind the flushed cheeks and smiles.
<<BR>>
They are ready to fight and die in your name.
[+SALT]

::wine-event-end
You expect to find Your Cousin making preparations for yet another grand ball.

Instead, you find them in their chambers, packing a bag.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('cousin')>>
"I've had enough of this."

"I'm going home."
<<BR>>
"Don't try to stop me."

[[Try to stop them]]
[[Let them go]]

::Let them go
<<do this.flag('left-cousin',1)>>
You say that you won't.

The Distant Cousin grab their pack, bids you farewell, and walks past you.

[[Continue|this.goto('end-choice')]]

::Try to stop them
You calmly remind them that it takes your fastest horses days just to reach the northern coast.
<<BR>>
"I don't care."
<<BR>>
They place another silken shirt in their pack, then pause.

"Do you know why I came here?"
<<BR>>
"It's because I believed that one day, I might rule, and that all this could be mine."
<<BR>>
"Don't get me wrong, I had no intention of playing the usurper, I was simply being realistic."

"I was second in line to the throne. Within a couple months of arriving, I was first."
<<BR>>
"I'd be lying if I said I didn't still want it."

They resume packing.
<<BR>>
"But I don't believe that day will come."

"So I'm not going to sit around and wait for it."
<<BR>>
They sling the bag over their shoulder.

"Farewell, Your Majesty. For however long it lasts, you now have my utter and complete support."

They march out the door.

<<BR>>
But when you arrive, the court is empty aside from The Noble Justiciar.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('justiciar')>>
"Ah, Your Majesty."

"You are wondering where everyone is, no doubt?"
<<BR>>
"They have stayed home with their families, for the most part."
<<BR>>
"I believe they sense what is coming. You feel it too, do you not?"

"A whole kingdom of dogs before a storm."
<<BR>>
"And so they choose to spend what may be their last moments with those that matter most."
<<BR>>
He sighs.

"And who could blame them?"

"Perhaps you should do the same."

[[Refuse]]
[[Leave]]

::Leave
<<do this.flag('left-justiciar', 1)>>
There is no sense in presiding over an empty court, so you tell him to heed his own words and find a better use of his time.

You leave him to consider what that might be.

[[Continue|this.goto('end-choice')]]

::Refuse
You tell him it is your court, and that you shall preside over it, courtiers or not.
<<BR>>
"Very well, Your Majesty."

"In that case, I was hoping to speak to you about something."
<<BR>>
"It's... about The Good Queen."
<<BR>>
"We had our differences - quite a lot of them, to be honest."

"But your mother was a good woman."

"Cut down in her prime, truly."

<<if this.stat.bread > 5>>"She would be proud of you."<<else>>"She loved you, no matter what."<<endif>>

"She would want you to know that."
<<BR>>
"I only wish..."

He stops, and reconsiders.
<<BR>>
"I hope I have been of use to you."
<<BR>>
You sit with him awhile in the lonely court.

He does not say much after that, but something tells you he appreciates the company despite the silence.

::scholar-end
<<do this.image('scholar')>>
He carries a stack of books in his lap, and moves with a quiet intensity.

"Good evening, Your Majesty."
<<BR>>
He does not stop moving, and says his simple greeting in passing.

[[Follow him]]
[[Leave him]]

::Leave him
He seems pre-occupied. Whatever it is that has captured his attention, best leave him to it.

Everyone has carefully chosen how to spend their potentially final day, and The Scholar is no exception.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('huntress')>>
You wonder how The Obsessed Huntress spends hers.

You half-expect for her to be standing there when you turn the next corner, armed with an ineffable purpose, or perhaps some words of wisdom.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('hall')>>
But she isn't.

[[Continue|this.goto('the-end2')]]

::Follow him
You turn around, quickly catch up and begin walking alongside him.

He continues talking as if he fully expected you to follow.
<<BR>>
"I have a new theory."

"I believe we have been ignoring crucial information all this time."
<<BR>>
"Tell me, have you not been watching the stars these past few weeks?"
<<BR>>
You admit that you haven't.
<<BR>>
"And neither have I!"

He laughs.
<<BR>>
You're not sure you've ever heard him laugh before.
<<BR>>
He makes a sudden turn, and you follow into a small office.

"I'll be honest, I'm not sure if it's a useful theory."
<<BR>>
"Not unless you have any bright ideas on how we might go about viewing the stars with The Sun's light drowning them out."
<<BR>>
"Hm. 'Bright' ideas."

He chuckles again, and starts setting his books down on a desk.
<<BR>>
You look around and see that there are more books, sheaves of papers littering the room. Some with covers caked in dust, others lying open and dog-eared.

He sets the last of his haul down.
<<BR>>
A moment later, he is flipping through pages, quill in hand.
<<BR>>
You sit with him awhile.

Occasionally, he asks for you to pass him a book. "No, not that one. Red cover, silver lining."
<<BR>>
His focus is intimidating, but it does not last forever.

He sets his pen down with a sigh.
<<BR>>
"Oh, if only we had more time."

He looks at you, and you notice the bags under his eyes.
<<BR>>
"I've seen my fair share. More than that, perhaps."

"But you... you're so young."
<<BR>>
"So much left to discover, so much left to learn."
<<BR>>
"You could've been a great Queen, in time."

"Time..."
<<BR>>
He rubs his eyes with thumb and forefinger.

"...Time for you to get going, I believe."
<<BR>>
"Leave this old man to his books."

"Have a good night, Your Majesty."
<<BR>>
You bid him the same, and tell him to try to get some sleep.

Later that night, you retreat to your chambers, lay down, and close your eyes. You realize that you are exhausted.

Nothing much has happened, and yet the anxiety of it all has haunted you all day.

You want nothing more but to fall asleep, but to fall asleep would mean the day is truly over, and the thought strikes that you may not have another.

So you lay there.

The day passes by quickly, and you gather for dinner late that evening.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('feast')>>
The royal kitchen has gone all out tonight, and have prepared a lavish feast.

It is a welcome relief from the stress of the previous week.
<<BR>>
The first course is exquisite: small portions of delicious stew consisting of mushrooms, shallots, and strips of wine-infused hare.
<<BR>>
You can tell the cook must have been planning tonight in advance.

The meat has been thoroughly marinated; judging from the size and texture, probably for at least a whole day.
<<BR>>
The second course looks as if it will top the first, as a variety of meats are brought out.

Before you have a chance to sample any, there is a clank, and you are suddenly doused in the contents of a nearby servant's pitcher.
<<BR>>
You don't even have time to react before a guard has tackled the servant to the ground, and others are rushing to check up on you.
<<BR>>
You're fine - far more soaked in ale than you'd prefer, but fine.

The Noble Justiciar immediately begins questioning the servant as if they has been put on trial:

You suppose that now, one could say they were already within The Empire's borders.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('roundTable')>>
In the coming days, the round table continues to meet, but you find it difficult to bother with their plots and plans.

All you can think of is how The Empire's takeover will fare.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('map')>>
Perhaps they'll stay true to their word, and solve the problems you could never hope to understand, allowing the land and people to thrive once again.
[-BREAD]
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('ball')>>
Perhaps they'll want to wed you off to some son of The Empire, joining the royal lines while ensuring one will overshadow the other.
[-WINE]
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('assassin')>>
Perhaps they'll prefer to stamp out your family more definitively, and have you and Your Cousin dealt with under cover of night.
[-SALT]
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('blank')>>
Perhaps they'll have nothing to do with you, simply letting time run its course as the identity of your once great kingdom is slowly erased.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('swordBroken')>>
In any case, your part in this story is over.

You will not be remembered.

"I say no."

<<do this.image('messenger')>>
The Slithering Emissary stands in silence, apparently expecting more to be said.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('sword')>>
"Well? You have your answer - will that be all?"
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('messenger')>>
"Ah..."
<<BR>>
"Perhaps, Your Majesty, you would simply like more time to consider?"
<<BR>>
"As I said earlier-"
<<BR "No.">>
<<do this.image('sword')>>
"If you wish to repeat this conversation, you are wasting my time and yours."
<<BR>>
"Now, if you would kindly remove yourself from my court, it would spare me the trouble of ordering the guards to have you removed."
[+SALT]
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('messenger')>>
His smile gone, The Emissary seems at a loss for words.

He stands, stunned for a moment, then gives a quick bow, and turns to leave.
<<BR>>
<<do this.image('sword')>>
You imagine you won't be hearing from him again any time soon.
